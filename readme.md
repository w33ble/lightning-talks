# Lightning Talks

~5 min lightning talks meant to be sprinkled into various meetups.

Curently focused on Javascript (browser and node.js), but not neccessarily limited to it.

## Possible topics

- [x] Wrangling arrays
- [X] You might not need Bluebird
- [ ] You might not need Lodash
- [ ] ES6 syntax, just the basics
- [ ] Getting started with Express.js
