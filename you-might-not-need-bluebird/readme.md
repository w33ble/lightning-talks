# You might not need Bluebird

Bluebird is a great Promise library that runs fast and has a lot of helpers. 

In my experience, `.map` and `.each` are the most useful of the helpers it offers.

This is a live-coding demo of how to get their functionality using native Promises
and some simple array manipulation.
